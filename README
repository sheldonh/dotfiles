Configuration files to pleasurize my terminal experience.

	cd $HOME
	git clone git://github.com/sheldonh/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
	.dotfiles/setup.sh

Sadly, Gnome Terminal blows away the %gconf symlink that setup.sh
creates. I've found no way of making it portable.

Most of this exists to provide a beautiful environment within which
to use vim as a Ruby editor.  The vim config itself is in a separate
repository:

Note that rbenv was designed by Mac-heads, so the rbenv support in
.bash_profile only works if the terminal emulator is configured to
simulate a login shell.  See
